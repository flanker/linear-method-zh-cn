# Build with users

# 与用户共建

Much of the early startup process is about learning what your customers want. You should seek out users or potential users for feedback, iterate, and be flexible to meet the demands of your customers and the market.

早期的创业过程大部分是关于了解你的客户想要什么。你应该寻求用户或潜在用户的反馈，进行迭代，并灵活地满足客户和市场的需求。

## Vision vs Feedback

## 愿景与反馈

However, your task as a founder is to find a balance between building toward your vision/intuition and building what the users want. Too vision-based products might miss user and market needs while too reactive products become Frankenstein creations without a clear purpose. You need to keep refining your product vision based on your user feedback.

然而，作为创始人，你的任务是在愿景和用户期望之间找到平衡。太过基于愿景，产品可能会错过用户和市场的需求。而太过被动的产品则会成为没有明确目的的科学怪人。你需要根据用户的反馈，不断完善产品愿景。

## Solve the problem not the feature

## 解决问题而不是实现功能

Understand that users will project their needs from the context or product they currently see, not the product that you’re trying to build. It’s common for users to ask for features you should add. Whenever they do, it’s important as a product builder that you ask them questions back. What is the use case? What is the problem they’re trying to solve with this feature or solution? How would their experience of the product be different if the problem was fixed?

要明白，用户会从他们目前实际看到的产品中找到出他们的需求，而不是你正在试图打造的产品。用户经常会要求你增加些功能。每当他们这样做的时候，作为一个产品建设者，你一定要反问他们。用例是什么？他们想用这个功能解决什么问题？如果这个问题得到解决，他们对产品的体验会有什么不同？

By pivoting the conversation away from a feature request and toward explaining the problem they are trying to solve, you move the discussion towards the pain point. In this conversation, you’ll learn whether the problem is valuable to solve or nice to have. It also allows you to explore multiple solutions to the problem, and to choose the right one within the context of your broader vision.

通过将对话从功能要求转移到他们试图解决的问题上，你将讨论转向了痛点。在这个对话中，你会了解到这个问题是有价值的，还是锦上添花的。它还会让你探索更多解决方案，最终选择最正确的那个。

## Build for the right users

## 为重要的用户创建

You may also talk to users who have a lot of feedback but who aren’t in your target demographic or aren’t it now. If you think you are building for things for early-stage startups, listening to an enterprise customer will likely set you on the wrong path and it’s unlikely that they will even become a customer.

你可以和那些有很多反馈的用户交谈，但他们可能并不是你的目标人群，或者说现在不是。如果你认为你的产品是为创业团队使用的，听取大企业用户的意见很可能会使你走上错误的道路，甚至他们都不太可能成为你的客户。

Incorporate the feedback and let it refine your product, but don’t let user feedback alone dictate what you build. You can become too reactive to user feedback. This is why it’s good to have goals and roadmaps, that help you balance the needs of the users and the needs of the company.

吸收反馈来完善你的产品，但不要完全让用户的反馈来决定你的产品。你会变得反应过度。这就是为什么要有目标和路线图，它可以帮助你平衡用户需求和公司目标。
