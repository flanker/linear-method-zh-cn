# Launch and keep launching 发布，持续发布

> There is a false belief there needs to be a singular moment for launch. This doesn’t have to be the case and a lot of times many startups launch multiple times. It usually works better than having one massive launch. The problem with massive launches is that it takes time to prepare and they are riskier. There is also an increased risk that the launch won’t work and all the work is wasted. By launching multiple times, you are building your story and brand over time and compounding the interested people have. Each launch builds more following, which then helps your future launches.

有一种错误的观点认为，需要有一个单独的发布时刻。情况并非如此，很多时候，许多初创企业都会多次发布。这比一次大规模的发布更好。大规模发布的问题是，需要长时间准备，而且风险更大。还有一个更大的风险是，发布可能会失败，那么所有的工作都白费了。通过多次发布，你建立了你的故事和品牌，随着时间的推移，人们对你的兴趣会越来越大。每次发布都会带来更多的追随者，又有助于未来的发布。

> Secondly, in the first months or years, your product is likely not a fit for everyone. It’s better to launch early, start getting users and momentum, than trying to wait for that perfect moment.

其次，在最初的几个月或几年，你的产品可能不适合每个人。尽早的发布，开始获得用户和动力，比试图等待一个完美的时刻要更好。

> Similar to changelogs, launching keeps reminding the market about the fact your company exists and you’re making process.

与更新日志类似，发布产品会不断提醒市场你的公司存在，你正在不断进展。

> For example, when we launched Linear we announced the company before we had the product built. We launched when we raised seed funding and evolved the product. We launched when we opened the product for everyone and added pricing. We launched when we did a Series A and evolved the product. Each of the launches had reached more people and generated more customers than the previous ones. Had we only launched once, it would have taken us 1.5 years to get to the state and we wouldn’t have learned as much and would have as many customers as we have today.

举个例子，当我们推出 Linear 时，我们在产品建成之前就宣布了公司的成立。我们在筹集种子资金和开发产品的时候就发布一次。我们在对外公开产品时和推出定价时也发布了。我们在做 A 轮融资时也发布了，并迭代了产品。每一次发布的产品都比之前的产品触达到更多的人，产生更多的客户。如果我们只发布了一次，我们会花 1.5 年的时间来达到这个状态，而且我们不会学到那么多东西，也不会有我们今天这么多的客户。
